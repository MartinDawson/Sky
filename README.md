# Sky

## To run
Tested on windows 7. Requires SQL Server for Entity Framework to create the tables.

- Cd 'Sky/Sky'
- Build the project to install the NuGet packages
- type `yarn` to install npm packages
- type `yarn run development` to start the app

## To Note
- Wasn't sure why UserProfile was needed a parameter to rewards service when we have an account number so I left it out

## Can be made better with:
- More generic error handling on the front-end
- More back end tests and Shallow Enzyme testing on the frontend
